        <p>
            When designing our website, we wanted to create a fun and playful 
            atmosphere that reflected the delicious and delightful nature of 
            our Bingfen dessert. We chose a soft pink color palette to complement 
            the sweetness of our dessert and evoke a sense of femininity and 
            elegance. We also wanted our brand name to have a memorable and catchy 
            ring to it, and so we decided to call it "Wendy's Bingfen." The name
             not only sounds like the well-known fast-food chain "Wendy's," but
              it also adds a personal touch by including the name of one of our
               founders. Overall, our website design is meant to be approachable 
               and inviting, encouraging visitors to explore our menu and try 
               out our delicious Bingfen for themselves.

        <p>
            Once upon a time, in the bustling city of College Park, there were 
            four friends who shared a deep love for Bingfen, a traditional 
            Chinese dessert made of Bingfen seeds and a variety of toppings. 
            Every weekend, they would venture out into the city in search of 
            the best Bingfen, but were always left disappointed by the lack of 
            quality and authenticity.<br>
            One day, while enjoying a particularly disappointing bowl of Bingfen,
            the friends looked at each other and simultaneously exclaimed, 
            "We could do better than this!" And that's how the idea for their 
            business was born.<br>
            Over the next few months, the friends worked tirelessly to perfect 
            their Bingfen recipe. They sourced the highest quality ingredients 
            and experimented with different combinations of toppings until they 
            had created a truly delicious and authentic dessert that they were 
            proud of.<br>
            With their recipe in hand, we decided to take the plunge and start 
            our own business. We scoured the city for the perfect location and 
            eventually found a small storefront in a trendy neighborhood. We 
            renovated the space themselves and added a few cozy touches to make 
            it feel like home.<br>
            On opening day, we were nervous but excited. They had no idea if
             anyone would show up, but they were determined to share our love 
             of Bingfen with the world. To our surprise, the store quickly 
             filled up with customers who were eager to try their dessert.<br>
             Word of mouth spread quickly and soon our Bingfen became the talk 
             of the town. People came from far and wide to try the delicious Chinese
              dessert, and the business grew rapidly.<br>
              With the success of our store, we decided to expand our business 
              further by creating an online platform. We wanted to make it easier
               for customers to order our delicious Bingfen from the comfort of 
               their own homes. And so, we worked hard to develop a user-friendly
                website where customers could browse our menu, place their orders, 
                and have their Bingfen delivered straight to their doorsteps.<br>
              And that, my friends, is the story of how our Bingfen business came to be.

                    We would like to express our sincere thanks to our friends 
                    <em>Yiqian Zhu</em> and <em>Kaiwen(Wendy) Lu</em> who gave us valuable pictures,
                    ideas, and feedback during the process of designing this website.
                     Without their input and support, this project would not have been 
                     possible. <br>
                     Additionally, we want to take a moment to express our appreciation 
                     for this class and our professor Nelson. We put in a lot of effort 
                     on this project because we are passionate about the making our webpage
                     (and our Bingfen business) and we wanted to create something that 
                     truly reflects that. Moreover, we would like to express our interest 
                     in any future TA positions that may become available.
